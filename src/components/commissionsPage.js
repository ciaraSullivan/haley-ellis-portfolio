                        In 2017, I received my BFA from Western Michigan University. My work comes from a deeply embedded fascination with nature, and my childhood obsession with dinosaurs and all things make-believe. I pull much of my inspiration from the natural
                        world and use it to inform the design of the creatures I create. When I’m not day-dreaming about dragons outside my window, I’m
                        working to combine my proficiency in traditional media with my ever growing skills in Photoshop and Procreate.
