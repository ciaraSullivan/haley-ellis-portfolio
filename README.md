Haley Ellis Portfolio

This is a website that I built as part of my React bootcamp course. In creating this website for a friend of mine, I also created a light-weight wireframe for a secure, fast-loading, easily customizable, image-based portfolio website. 

Features:
- Simple scaffolding for image data, titles, and descriptions that is easy for clients to understand and update
- Image security features including CDNs, barring image dragging, and barring right-clicking on images
- React Helmet allows for enhanced SEO optimization for this single-page application

Enjoy!
